## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
unzip('activity.zip')
activityData <- read.csv(file="activity.csv")
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
### Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
stepsByDate <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activityData, FUN=sum)
barplot(stepsByDate$steps, names.arg=stepsByDate$date, ylab='No. of Steps',las=2)
```

### Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day

The mean number of steps taken per days is `r mean(stepsByDate$steps)`

The median number of steps taken per days is `r median(stepsByDate$steps)`

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
